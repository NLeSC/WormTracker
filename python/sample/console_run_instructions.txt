To process a video (serial) from the terminal using a .yml config file:
python runbatchanalysis.py -i configfile.yml -s

To process a video in parallel (not working on my mac for some reason, but works everywhere else):
(uses all available cores, splitting each region to a separate process)
python runbatchanalysis.py -i configfile.yml
